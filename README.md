# CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs - Fall 2019

Solutions to CS224W Online version homework at http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/. You can still find my code for the homework question if it requires coding to solve but not to submit.

You can find the full video lectures at https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1jE41177A4?p=1 or http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-videos-2019/. The lectures also sporatically appear on Youtube.

This class talks about multiple aspects of graph data and their methods of analysis. If you only want to learn about Graphical Neural Net, lectures titled **8. Graph Neural Networks** and **10. Deep Generative Models for Graphs** have all the information you need. The homework for those lectures are homework 2.3 and 2.4. **9. Graph Neural Networks: Hands-on Session** video might help you with the homework. 

***Note: My implementations for homework 2.3 and 2.4 might not satisfy you, because they definitely do not satisfy me. Please head to the disscussion section if you want to talk about them (or any other homework questions). I would very much appreciate your views on these.***
